          * Excursions in Modern Mathematics introduces readers to the power and beauty of math. By developing an appreciation for the aesthetics and applicability of mathematics, readers who previously felt math was an “unknowable” subject can approach it with a new perspective. Contemporary topics ranging from elections, to networks, to analyzing data show readers that math is an accessible tool that can be applicable and interesting for anyone. Refinement and updating of examples and exercises, plus increased resources, makes the 9th Edition a relevant, accessible, and complete program.
